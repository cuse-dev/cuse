## Description

The `start` command launches virtual computers in your project. You can start a specific computer by providing its identifier, or start all computers defined in your configuration.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `identifier` | Optional identifier of a specific computer to start |
| `--detached` | Run the computers in the background |
| `--force` | Force a restart if already running |

## Example

```bash
# Start all computers in the project
npx @cusedev/cli start

# Start a specific computer
npx @cusedev/cli start my-computer

# Start in detached mode
npx @cusedev/cli start --detached

# Force restart a computer
npx @cusedev/cli start my-computer --force
```

## Output

For each started computer, you'll see:
- Container ID
- Access URLs:
  - API endpoint: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>`
  - noVNC interface: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>/novnc/`
  - VNC endpoint: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>/vnc/`

A summary table of all started computers will be displayed at the end.
