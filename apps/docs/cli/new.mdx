title: 'new'
description: 'Create a new virtual computer'
---

## Usage

```bash
npx @cuse/cli new [computer-name] [options]
```

## Description

The `new` command creates a new virtual computer in your Cuse project. It sets up a Docker container with the specified operating system and configures the necessary services for remote access.

## Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `computer-name` | Optional name for the new computer. If not provided, you'll be prompted to enter one |
| `--template` | Computer template (e.g., 'ubuntu') |
| `--platform` | Platform choice (currently supports: 'linux') |
| `--config` | Path to configuration file (defaults to 'cuse.config.yml') |

## Interactive Configuration

If options are not provided, the command will prompt you for:
1. Computer name (generates a unique name if not specified)
2. Operating system selection

## Example

```bash
# Create a new computer with interactive prompts
npx @cuse/cli new

# Create a computer with a specific name
npx @cuse/cli new my-computer

# Create a computer with specific platform
npx @cuse/cli new my-computer --platform linux
```

## Output

After successful creation, you'll see:
- Container ID
- Access URLs:
  - API endpoint: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>`
  - noVNC interface: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>/novnc/`
  - VNC endpoint: `http://localhost:4242/<computer-name>/vnc/`

## Troubleshooting

If services fail to start, the command will suggest:
1. Checking if the proxy is running: `npx @cuse/cli proxy status`
2. Checking container logs: `docker logs <container-id>`
3. Checking proxy logs: `docker logs cuse-proxy`
4. Trying to restart: `npx @cuse/cli start <computer-name>`
