## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

### Docker
Docker is required for all Cuse setups. Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine.
    
You can download Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

### Anthropic API Key
If you're following the Quick Start Example, you'll need an Anthropic API key.
    
1. Sign up at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an API key from your dashboard
3. Save it to your environment:
```bash
# In your terminal
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Or create a .env file in the example directory
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key" > .env
```

## Add to Existing Project

Learn how to integrate Cuse into your existing project.

### 1. Install and initialize
```bash
npm install @cusedev/core
npx @cusedev/cli init
npx @cusedev/cli new
```

### 2. Start the computer
```bash
npx @cusedev/cli start

### 3. Implement Cuse
Create the computer instance:
```typescript
const computer = new Computer({
  config: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4242/your-computer-name',
  },
});
